            <p>Bring to the table win-win survival strategies to ensure proactive domination. At the end of the day,
                going forward, a new normal that has evolved from generation X is on the runway heading towards a
                streamlined cloud solution. User generated content in real-time will have multiple touchpoints for

                key performance indicators offline to maximise the long tail. Keeping your eye on the ball while
                performing a deep dive on the start-up mentality to derive convergence on cross-platform integration.

            <h2>INTERESTS</h2>
            <p>Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors. In the winter, I am an avid
                skier and novice ice climber. During the warmer months here in Colorado, I enjoy mountain biking, free
                climbing, and kayaking.

                When forced indoors, I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre movies and television shows, I am an
                aspiring chef, and I spend a large amount of my free time exploring the latest technology advancements
                in the front-end web development world.</p>
